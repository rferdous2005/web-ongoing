    <h2>Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The VAPT program identifies security vulnerabilities in the systems, networks, and applications of critical government agencies. So far, VAPT has been conducted
      on 2,246 web applications, servers, network devices, and mobile applications
      across 32 government institutions, resulting in 51 reports.</p>
    <h4>Server VAPT</h4>
    <p>Vulnerability assessment and penetration test on server operating system. 
      This is a black box test which doesn’t require user credential and this test will identify possible installed services, 
      running services, open ports, service version detection, network communications, patch information etc</p>
    <h4>Website VAPT</h4>
    <p>Vulnerability assessment and penetration test on website to detect possible vulnerabilities. 
      This VAPT doesn’t require user credential. This test will identify web technologies and versions, SQL injection, 
      Cross-site scripting, Unrestricted file upload, Web backdoor, Directory traversal etc.
      Note: Each unique sub-domain will consider as domain.</p>
    <h4>Web Application VAPT</h4>
    <p>Vulnerability assessment and penetration test on web application to detect possible vulnerabilities. 
      This test may require web application user credential to conduct vulnerability assessment to detect SQL injection, 
      Cross-site scripting, Unrestricted file upload, Local or remote file inclusion, Authentication bypass, Misconfiguration etc.
      Note: Each unique sub-domain will consider as domain.</p>
