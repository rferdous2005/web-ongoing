          <p>
              At <strong>BGD e-GOV CIRT</strong> (Bangladesh e-Government Computer Incident Response Team), we are at the forefront of securing Bangladesh's digital future. Established in March 2016, following the infamous cyberattack on Bangladesh Bank, our organization was formed as a critical initiative to protect the nation's rapidly expanding digital landscape.

              Operating under the <strong>Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC)</strong> and governed by the <strong>Cybersecurity Act of 2023</strong>, we act as the National Computer Emergency Response Team (N-CERT) for the country.
